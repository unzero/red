# Red: Rust Editor. 
Red intends to help you to edit files or execute commands over the network using a ssh connection. The vision of the project is to provide a web based solution similar to [Puty](https://www.putty.org/).

The tool is developed using Rust language and Cargo package manager.

This is a learning project. It may have logical errors or code smells.
